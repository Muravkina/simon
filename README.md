##Simon Says##

Simon says is a childhood game, favourite all around the world.
It generates a growing sequence of colors, that the player has to repeat.

Press `Start` to start a game. You will see a sequence of blinking colors. Try to memorize and repeat it by pressing the matching buttons to advance to the next level. The number of blinking colors will increase with each round. If the the pressed sequence is not correct, a window will pop up and show a number of completed levels.
